# Unity Utils

Various utility functions and classes I use across my Unity projects.

### Installation

This package needs [NaughtyAttributes](https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes). In Unity, go to **Package Manager > Install package from git URL**, then paste one URL after the other:

```
https://github.com/dbrizov/NaughtyAttributes.git#upm
```

```
https://github.com/aureliendossantos/unity-utils.git
```

Note that the package must be **manually updated** when a new version is available.
